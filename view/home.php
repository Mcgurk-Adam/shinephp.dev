		<h1>Secure by default</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Uses only PDO for connecting to the databaseâ€¦no mysqli anywhere.</li>
			<li>We only implement cURL securely (no certificate disabling!)</li>
			<li>The data validation scripts are built with an "allowlist" mindset, instead of a "denylist", making applications even more secure.</li>
